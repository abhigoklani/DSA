//an array of n elements is given, not suppose each element is the weight of the stone, now u have to pick 2 heaviest stones and when they both collide the weight reduces by doing substraction(eg 15, 13 so remains weight is 2) , now put the remaining weight again into array, after repeating the same step again and again only 1 stone will be left, so you have to tell the weight of the stone.  #include <iostream>
